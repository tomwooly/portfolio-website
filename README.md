# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and background. The site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and incorporates modern web development techniques such as responsive design, custom fonts, file uploads, border animations, and a contact form.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Custom Fonts**: Integrated custom fonts for unique typography and branding.
- **Animated Borders**: Created visually appealing animated borders for images and sections to enhance the user experience.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Incorporated JavaScript functionality for smoother user interactions and dynamic content.
- **File Upload Button**: A working file upload button to allow visitors to download my CV or any other downloadable resources.
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to showcase projects with details, images, and links to their GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form allowing visitors to send messages directly via email. The form includes basic JavaScript validation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3**: For the styling and layout, including custom animations, responsive media queries, and flexbox for layout.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing interactivity and adding dynamic features, including contact form validation.
- **Custom Fonts**: Leveraged Google Fonts or locally hosted fonts to create a personalized look and feel.
- **CSS Animations**: Used keyframes to animate borders and other elements for a more dynamic experience.
- **Contact Form**: Implemented a form using HTML and JavaScript for validation, and ready for backend integration (e.g., via EmailJS or a server).
